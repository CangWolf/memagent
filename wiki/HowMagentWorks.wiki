= Details =

 # *get gets* command goes to normal servers farm. If one server failed, magent will try read from backup servers farm
 # If *get gets* command had multi keys, magent will walk every key one by one as above.
 # *delete incr decr add set replace prepend append cas* command goes to both normal servers farm and backup servers fram at the same time
 # When client disconnected from magent, magent will keep connections to servers farm instead of close them.

= Suggestions =
 # run magent on the same server which client runs. client connects to 127.0.0.1, which is faster
